# Embedded Systems Showcase – ATmega16 Assembly Projects for Real‑World Hardware Control

### Project Overview  
This repository contains a collection of **ATmega16 assembly programs** focused on hardware control and automation projects.  
Each `.asm` file implements low‑level routines for managing microcontroller peripherals, demonstrating direct register manipulation and embedded systems design.

### Included Programs  
1. **ATmega16_LED_Control.asm** – Controls individual LEDs or LED arrays using GPIO pins.  
2. **CafeteraDomotica.asm** – Implements logic for an automated coffee maker, including timing and control sequences.  
3. **Ctrl4Ports.asm** – Demonstrates reading from and writing to multiple ports for expanded I/O control.  
4. **Timers_Ctrl_LEDRGB.asm** – Uses hardware timers to drive RGB LED color patterns and effects.
